# Testing PIC18F46K42 XPRESS Board

Initial testing of Microchip XPRESS board with the PIC18F46K42 target MCU.

The example Microchip Code Configurator was used to generate most of the code in the initial commit of this project.
It was my first attempt at using the Code Configurator tool. Example code for main was found in UART.h.

All this first example does is echo back code received on the USART Rx line. In this case no interrupts have been used.

## More info on the DM182026

The documents on that site are helpful but what I did not find was simple examples specifically for this board before going
ahead and trying out the code configuator. The default program in the PIC18F46K42 appeared to set most the pins as GPIO and 
send a pulse to them periodically. The USART in the target MCU was not interacting at all with the MCU on the board providing 
the USB to serial functions. 

### Probing the DM182026 for Serial Signal

* The serial signal from the USB multifunction MCU was verified as transmitting a serial signal by 
  testing with PuTTY on a computer and probing with a Digital Storage Oscilloscope.
* It was verified that the other side of a buffer resistor was connected to RB7 using an Ohm meter (the board was disconnected 
  from the USB for this test).

* The serial signal from PuTTY would be seen on RB7 of the target PIC if the pin were configured as an input. One would most 
  certainly want to configure RB6 as the PIC TX pin and RB7 as the PIC RX pin.
  
## Code Configurator settings

The code in this project was primarily generated by the Code Configurator. The settings used may not be optimal at all. 
The initial goal was just to get the UART of the target PIC to talk to the UART of the interface PIC.
